Hello! Swapnil nagare here ,this project is basically on colour detection program using python. 
we all know that colors are made up of three primary colors: Red, Green, and Blue. Their intensities can be measured
between 0 to 255 and by combining them we get 6 million different color values. so i take one picture in it and also
import multiple module , in program after every action i mention it's meaning in comment so it is easy to understand
the all program.
                                                                                             Thank You!!!
